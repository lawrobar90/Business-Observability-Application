      "businessRationale": "Typical click-and-collect order placement for a weekly shop is quick but involves product discovery and selecting collection options; faster placement reduces abandonment and increases orders per session.",

      "estimatedDuration": 2,
      "businessRationale": "Slot selection is a short, high-impact decision point; inability to find a slot or slow availability checks leads to abandonment or switching to delivery, directly affecting revenue and store workload.",
