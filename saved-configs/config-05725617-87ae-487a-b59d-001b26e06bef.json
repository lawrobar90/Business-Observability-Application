      "timestamp": "2025-11-21T00:00:00.000Z",
      "estimatedDuration": 2,
      "businessRationale": "Notifications must be delivered quickly and reliably; timely reminders drive renewal engagement and reduce churn. Delays reduce open rates and downstream renewals.",

      "category": "Authentication",
      "estimatedDuration": 3,
      "businessRationale": "Low friction authentication preserves conversion; excessive friction or failures increase abandonment of the renewal flow and reduce retained premium.",

      "businessRationale": "Fast, accurate recalculation is essential; slow or inconsistent pricing reduces trust and conversion. This step produces the 'renewal price shown' event tied to revenue.",

      "businessRationale": "Payment success is the primary revenue event for renewals. Failures or long latency cause immediate revenue loss and increase churn risk. Policy bind must be atomic and auditable.",
