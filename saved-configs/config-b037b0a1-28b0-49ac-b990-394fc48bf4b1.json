      "timestamp": "2025-11-21T00:00:00.000Z",
      "estimatedDuration": 10,
      "businessRationale": "Fast, low-friction reporting increases claim capture and reduces call centre load; immediate creation of claim record enables downstream workflows and SLA timers that affect customer satisfaction and regulatory reporting.",

      "category": "Triage",
      "estimatedDuration": 30,
      "businessRationale": "Automated triage reduces manual handling costs and speeds time-to-first-response; accurate validation prevents fraudulent payouts and ensures correct reserving which impacts loss ratio and capital planning.",

      "businessRationale": "Assessment is the most resource-intensive step; timely assessments reduce cycle time and supplier costs. Long assessment delays increase customer dissatisfaction and raise churn risk, while rushed assessments increase overpayment risk.",
