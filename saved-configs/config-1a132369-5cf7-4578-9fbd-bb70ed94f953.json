      "serviceName": "FaultDetectionService",
      "description": "Automated telemetry or operator report triggers an alert for a fault on equipment (e.g., SIMATIC PLC, SINAMICS drive). Alert is ingested by Siemens remote monitoring platform and a ticket is created.",

      "timestamp": "2025-11-21T00:00:00.000Z",
      "estimatedDuration": 10,
      "businessRationale": "Fast detection (minutes) is required to minimize production downtime; quicker detection increases chance of remote remediation and reduces costly onsite interventions.",

      "category": "Diagnostics",
      "estimatedDuration": 60,
      "businessRationale": "Remote diagnostics typically take under an hour for initial triage; successful remote fix avoids expensive onsite dispatch and preserves revenue by reducing downtime penalties.",

      "businessRationale": "Onsite repair and commissioning for industrial components often require several hours; successful first-time fix reduces follow-up visits and increases customer satisfaction and contract renewal likelihood.",
